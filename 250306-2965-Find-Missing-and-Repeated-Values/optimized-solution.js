/**
 * ðŸ“š Solution 1 (Counting)
 *
 * Intuition:
 * The key insight is that we can use a counting approach. If we count the frequency of each number, the one with frequency 2 is our repeated number, and the one with frequency 0 is our missing number.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Calculate the total number of elements expected (nÂ²).
 * 2. Create a frequency counter for numbers 1 to nÂ².
 * 3. Iterate through the grid and count the occurrences of each number.
 * 4. Identify the number that appears twice (frequency = 2) as 'a'.
 * 5. Identify the number that is missing (frequency = 0) as 'b'.
 * 6. Return [a, b].
 *
 * Complexity:
 * - Time complexity: O(nÂ²)
 * - Space complexity: O(nÂ²)
 *
 * @param grid
 * @returns {[number, number]}
